Greetings, Facebook My advertising account was unexpectedly disabled because I didn't adhere to Facebook's advertising policies. Since I always followed your rules and procedures, I genuinely think that this was an error. I'm hoping you'll check at my ad account more carefully and revive it as soon as you can. I appreciate you.

Hello, Facebook I was informed that my ad account had been disabled due to a Policy violation. My ad account should be enabled again as soon as possible. I hope this was a mistake.

Greetings, Facebook You eventually destroyed me today when I read a warning that my ad account had been deactivated due to a rules violation. What sort of infringement of policy? What has changed now after I spent $3,000 running advertisements on your site where everything was working before? You're removing me from your platform while I'm advertising Yukon excursions to people all over the world? What makes it possible? You've been approving my adverts from the beginning, so what happens next? I honestly feel that this was an error, and I sincerely hope that you will look at my account and reactivate it as soon as you can. I appreciate you.

Hi Facebook, I'm writing to you regarding the problem that I've been having with my advertising account. I spent the entirety of my advertising budget on Facebook, after which I increased that budget; however, I recently discovered that my advertising account had been cancelled!!!! Why? There is no compelling reason for it because every one of my activities is within the law and is in accordance with your policies and standards. Because I was so careful to adhere to all of your guidelines and regulations, I can only assume that this was done inadvertently. Looking forward!

Hey Meta Pro Team, 

I'm not exactly sure which Policy I violated if any. I'll provide any information you deem necessary and I'm willing to comply with everything or some more information you might ask from my side. I'm really hoping we can get this Review across.
